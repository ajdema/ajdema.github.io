        <h2>Project Overview</h2>
        <p>In this project I insert a synthetic object into a video I captured which is a basic fundamental of AR. The idea is to use 2D points from the video and 3D coordinates that are known to calibrate the camera for each frame and use projection matrix to project the 3D coordinates of your synthetic object into your 2D frames in the video.</p>

        <h2>Input Video</h2>
        <p>
          I drew a regular grid pattern on a box so that I could easily annotate the points and measure their real 3D coordinates. I then took a simply video in which I pan around the box.
        </p>

        <h2>Keypoints with known 3D world coordinates</h2>
          <p>
            The first step is to extract the first frame from the video and annotate some keypoints for that image, I chose to annotate 32 keypoints in the end.
            Next, you need to define 3D cooridinates for those same points. Since I drew a grid with 2 inch spacing on my box, I was easily able to define 3D coordinates for each of my 2D keypoints.
            Now that we have 2D keypoints for the first frame we need to propogate those for each frame in the video. <br/>
            To do this I used <b>cv2.calcOpticalFlowPyrLK</b> which is Optical Flow with the Lucas-Kanade method for feature point tracking. It computes the motion of a list of points between two frames by using local gradients of pixel intensities to get the displacement. There were some points that it struggled to properly track which gave weird results, so I simply removed those points from my projection matrix calculation.

            <h2>Calibrating the Camera</h2>
    <p>
        Now that we have the 2D points for each frame in the video, we can calibrate the camera by finding a projection matrix that maps the 3D coordinates of points in the world to their corresponding 2D image coordinates. The process involves solving for the camera's projection matrix using the least squares method, which minimizes the error between the predicted and actual 2D points.
    </p>
    <p>
        To do this, we need to solve the equation:
        <br>
        <strong>p = P * X</strong>
        <br>
        where <strong>p</strong> is the 2D point in homogeneous coordinates (x, y, 1), <strong>P</strong> is the 3x4 camera projection matrix, and <strong>X</strong> is the 3D point in homogeneous coordinates (X, Y, Z, 1). The goal is to find <strong>P</strong> that best maps the 3D points to the corresponding 2D points across all frames.
    </p>
    <p>
        The matrix equation can be rewritten for multiple points as:
        <br>
        <strong>[p₁] [x₁ y₁ z₁ 1] </strong><br>
        <strong>[p₂] [x₂ y₂ z₂ 1]</strong><br>
        <strong>[p₃] [x₃ y₃ z₃ 1]</strong><br>
        <strong>...   ...   ...   ...</strong><br>
        <strong> [pₖ] [xₖ yₖ zₖ 1]</strong><br>
        </p>
        <p>
        We can solve this system of equations using a least squares approach, where we minimize the sum of squared differences between the actual and predicted 2D points. The resulting matrix <strong>P</strong> consists of the intrinsic and extrinsic parameters of the camera, which include the camera's focal length, principal point, and orientation in space.

            <h2>Projecting a cube in the Scene</h2>
            <p>Now that we have a projection matrix for each frame, we just use it to project the 3D coordinates of our cube onto that 2D frame and then draw the cube onto the frame. </p>
