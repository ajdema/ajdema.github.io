        <p>
          In this project I make use of homographies to warp images such that
          transforms between images are projective. This is a technique often
          used to create panoramas.

        <p>
          I took two images of the campanile standing in the same spot but
          slightly turning my phone for the second photo. I also took several
          photos of rectanuglar objects in my room to rectify.

        <h2>Recovering Homographies</h2>
        <p>
          A homography is a transformation that maps points from one plane to
          another using a 3x3 matrix. Given two images, we want to find the
          homography matrix <em>H</em> such that corresponding points in both
          images satisfy:
        </p>

        <div class="equation">p' = H * p</div>

        <p>
          Here, <em>p</em> and <em>p'</em> are homogeneous coordinates of
          corresponding points in the two images, and <em>H</em> is the 3x3
          homography matrix. To recover <em>H</em>, we need a set of point
          correspondences between the two images.
        </p>

        <h3>Setting up the System of Equations</h3>

        <p>
          The homography matrix <em>H</em> has 8 degrees of freedom (since the
          9th element can be set to 1 for scaling). Given at least 4 pairs of
          corresponding points, we can solve for the elements of
          <em>H</em> using a system of linear equations.
        </p>

        <p>
          For each pair of points <em>(x, y)</em> in the first image and
          <em>(x', y')</em> in the second image, we can derive the following
          equations:
        </p>

        <div class="equation">
          x' = h1*x + h2*y + h3<br />
          y' = h4*x + h5*y + h6<br />
          w' = h7*x + h8*y + 1
        </div>

        <p>
          To eliminate the non-linear dependency on <em>w'</em>, we divide by
          <em>w'</em> and express the system as:
        </p>

        <div class="equation">
          x' = (h1*x + h2*y + h3) / (h7*x + h8*y + 1)<br />
          y' = (h4*x + h5*y + h6) / (h7*x + h8*y + 1)
        </div>

        <p>
          Rearranging the terms, we obtain two linear equations for each
          correspondence:
        </p>

        <div class="equation">
          x' * (h7*x + h8*y + 1) = h1*x + h2*y + h3<br />
          y' * (h7*x + h8*y + 1) = h4*x + h5*y + h6
        </div>

        <h3>Matrix Form</h3>

        <p>
          We can represent the system of equations in matrix form as
          <em>Ah = b</em>, where <em>h</em> is a vector containing the 8 unknown
          elements of the homography matrix, and <em>A</em> and <em>b</em> are
          constructed from the point correspondences.
        </p>

        <p>
          For each correspondence, the following two rows are added to
          <em>A</em>:
        </p>

        <div class="equation">
          [-x, -y, -1, 0, 0, 0, x'*x, x'*y, x']<br />
          [ 0, 0, 0, -x, -y, -1, y'*x, y'*y, y']
        </div>

        <p>
          We can then solve this overdetermined system using a least-squares
          method to recover the vector <em>h</em>, which can be reshaped into
          the 3x3 matrix <em>H</em>:
        </p>

        <div class="equation">
          H = <br />
          [h1 h2 h3<br />
          h4 h5 h6<br />
          h7 h8 1]
        </div>

        <h3>Application</h3>

        <p>
          Once the homography matrix <em>H</em> is computed, it can be used to
          warp one image into the coordinate space of another image, or to
          rectify an image by mapping it to a known geometric shape (e.g., a
          square or rectangle).
        </p>
        <section>
          <h2>Warping Images</h2>
          <p>
            Once the homography is estimated, the next step is to re-project one
            image onto another to create a seamless stitch. Let's assume we are
            projecting Image 1 onto Image 2. To ensure smooth re-projection, we
            use an inverse warp technique. This begins by calculating the
            bounding box for the final image. We first take the four corners of
            Image 1 and apply the homography to map it onto the coordinate space
            of Image 2, determining the area where the final image will appear.
            Next, we interpolate the pixel values from Image 1 to find their
            corresponding locations in the output image.
          </p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h2>Image Rectification</h2>
          <p>
            To confirm that my warping function and homography is working
            correctly, I rectified a few images. This means taking photos of a
            rectangualr object at an angle so that the object does not appear
            perfectly rectangualr, then warping that image onto a rectangle to
            show the object 'straight on'

          <h2>Blend the images into a mosaic</h2>
          <p>
            Now for the fun part I blended together images to create a mosaic. I
            used my two images of the campanile. The means to do this is to use
            my warp function to warp one image onto the other using the
            homography created from the correspondence points. Next you need to
            stitch the images together. However, if you simply just take an
            average of pixels when stitching them together you will get
            inconsistent results. A better option is to use blending with an
            alpha mask which allows for a smooth transition where the imags
            overlap. You further need to keep track of if a given pixel is
            contributed to by one or two images and normalize accordingly.

            You might notice in the bottom middle of my image there is an edge
            where the images don't line up too well. This is due to the fact
            that I turned my body instead of the camera when taking these
            photos. This inspired me to take more photos of the inside of my
            room and a beautiful landscape to create more mosaics, this time being careful to only turn
            the camera around its focal point. Below are the results of these mosaics.

            <h2>Project Overview</h2>
            <p>
              In this part of the project the goal is to create mosaics like in part A,
               but instead fo manually selecting correspondences, I'll automaticlaly detect significant features in images 
               and use those points for correspondences. Much os this part of the project is based on the 
               <a href="https://inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/~cs180/fa24/hw/proj4/Papers/MOPS.pdf"> “Multi-Image Matching using Multi-Scale Oriented Patches” by Brown et al.</a> paper.

            <h2> Corner Detection </h2>
            <p>
                The first approach to detecting features uses Harris Corner detection which is detailed in section 2 of the MOPS paper. 
                The idea is to take an outer product of gradients in the x and y direction giving you a harris matrix. 
                Then looking at a window of this matrix you take the harmonic mean of the eigenvalues to determine a points "corner-strength". 
                If both eigenvalues are small that's a flat region, if one eigenvalue is large and one small, that's an edge, if btoh eigenvalues are large, that's a corner. 
                All points above a certain strength that aren't too close are considered interest points. Unfortunately the result of this is a very dense set of points that would be inefficient to use.

            <h2> Adaptive non-maximal suppression </h2>
            <p>
                One solution to our overly dense set of interest points is to use adaptive non-maximal suppression. 
                This technique is detailed in section 3 of the MOPS paper. At a basically level we would like to have say <em>n</em> points that are relatively spread out and are highly interesting. 
                The algorithm to give us exactly this result defines a supression radius which is the minimum distance to a another keypoint with a significantly stronger response strength, 
                mathematically: \( r_i = \min_i \left| \vec{x_i} - \vec{x_j} \right| \quad \forall \vec{x_j} : h(\vec{x_i}) < c_{\text{robust}} h(\vec{x_j}) \). We compute this for every keypoint and then take the K highest points. 
                Per the paper's recommendation I set \(c_{robust} = 0.9) and took 500 points.
